# Fake_Landing_Site
The Odin Project's fake landing site project, creating a moden website with flexbox.

The project uses a system of flexboxes to create a dynamic display which adjusts to the users screensize, with multiple different sections for different styling.


Project mimic's a Project Wingman Fanpage, a video game released in 2020.
The video background is the 2020 Trailer for the game.

Monarch Logo found from the game itself.
All content comes from the official Kickstarter images released for the game by Sector D2.
